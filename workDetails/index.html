        <h3> Work Experience Details </h3>
        <div class="highlight">
	<p>	
    
<p>
    I work as a software engineer in Software Integrity Group at Synopsys Inc. (India), located at Prestige Blue Chip, Bengaluru, India. 
	My current focus is on development state-of-the-art lightweight, scalable, 
	and precise static/program analysis tool that detects security vulnerabilities in software code to safeguard it from different types of attacks.
	My research interests span across several aspects of program analysis (also called static anlaysis), software security, software verification, and software engineering.  </p0>
		
    <p> My research work earlier at TRDDC, TCS Research, between 2013 and July 2022 (prior to joining Synopsys Inc.) has been on <i> postprocessing of alarms</i>.
	  During this time period, more particularly I aimed to improve usability of static analysis tools, by reducing the number of alarms 
	    by their grouping, classification, and automated elimination. 
	    Moreover, I aimed to simplify the process of manual inspection of alarms, by providing review-assistance to the users.
	    This research work has been mainly in the context of 
	    (1) verification and validation of safety-critical systems (Embedded systems), 
	    (2) analysis and verification of smart contracts, and (3) 
	    improving the state of program analysis and alarms postprocessing by using machine learning.  
</p> 

<p> Between 2011 and 2013, I worked on design and development of a commercial static analysis tool tool, TCS Embedded Code Analyzer (TCS ECA). 
I contributed by designing techniques to detect defects of unique types, and techniques for improving precision of underlying analyses such as value and pointer analysis. 
Prior to that, I worked on automated test data generation for different coverage criteria (2009-2011), and structuring and composing of software development artifacts in software product line engineering (2007-2009). </p>

Based on the research work, I have (co)-authored <a href="./index.html#sec:publications">19 peer-reviewed conference papers</a>, and filed <a href="./index.html#sec:patents">14 unique patents</a> of which 10 are granted in one or more jurisdictions and the other four are currently under examination.</p> 

<p>
    Before joining TRDDC, TCS, in 2007, I worked with IBM India as a developer for around 15 months.
